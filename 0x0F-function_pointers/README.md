# 0x0F. C - Function pointers
In this chapter of the ALX experience I learn about function pointers and the beautiful conveniences they are.
By the end of this, I'm expected to know
- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
